> ## ðŸ‘€ small project to scrap vacant jobs from jobmag.com

This project got me interested in programing. So then, I use to V.A for Real estate company called Ridge Point 
holding as Data administrator.The Job title is just a fancy word for a data entry assistant and task was very repetitive, a train track. 
I got a developer to automate the task, but it meant splitting my pay on any edit. That was too much power over my efficiency.

- Puppeteer.js => The dev tool to inspect the platform 
- Express.js => I had to host the project in case I'd to work with someone PC
- Docx.js wrote fetched data to docx to be uploaded in these [format](https://github.com/ekamanelly/scrapper/blob/master/upload)
- React, had to cloth the shameless server with some [love](https://github.com/ekamanelly/scrapper/blob/master/kfront)



#you can make use these commands for the server 
- after clone
- cd /scrapper
- npm install
- Start server `npm run start` or `yarn start` 

- server port is on `2000`


#you can make use these commands for the client
- after clone
- cd /scrapper/kfront
- npm install
- Start server `npm run start` or `yarn start` 

- client port is on `3000`



FYI: since the last time it was working they should have changed their UI, so some things will brake


So I think that all
